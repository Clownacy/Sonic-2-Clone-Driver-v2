Clownacy's Sonic 2 Clone Driver v2 (v2.7)

This is a heavily-modified version of Sonic 1's SMPS sound driver (which itself is a modified early SMPS 68k Type 1b), designed to work as a replacement for Sonic 2's SMPS sound driver (improved Z80 port of Sonic 1's driver). This driver retains the SMPS 68k Type 1b base, and so it operates on the 68k.
It is outfitted with many of the features found in Sonic 2's driver, along with some features from other drivers, including Sonic 3's, Sonic & Knuckles', Sonic 3D Blast's, and Knuckles' Chaotix's sound driver (all modified SMPS Z80 Type 2). While designed for Sonic 2, this driver can be installed in a Sonic 1 disassembly. Files and instructions for this are provided in the driver's threads on Sonic Retro and SSRG (Sonic Stuff Research Group). Links are available at the bottom of the README.

The following games and disassemblies are officially supported:
- Sonic 1 Git disassembly
- Sonic 2 Xenowhirl 2007 disassembly (users must update their copy of AS to that of the Git disasm)
- Sonic 2 Git disassembly

This driver is intended to have its sound/music files in SMPS2ASM v0.2 (.asm) format: assembled (.bin) files are not supported.

This driver is designed for use with 'The Macroassembler AS', found here:
