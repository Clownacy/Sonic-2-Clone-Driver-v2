19/04/2014
= v2.1.1 =

09/03/2015
= v2.2.6 =
- Sonic 2-ifications
	- Added to FMUpdateTrack and PSGUpdateTrack the way S2's driver does
	- Made TrackSetRest no longer continue to FinishTrackUpdate
	- Fixed modulation on rests by adding a check to DoModulation (noticeable at start of ARZ's theme after it's looped)
	- Relocated a check in FMPrepareNote to occur a little earlier
	- Changed a reference to a locret in Sound_PlayBGM with one to .bgm_loadMusic, which should make it so that the extra life music can interrupt itself
	- Made .bgmnot1up clear v_fadeout_counter
	- .bmg_fmloadloop and .bgm_psgloadloop now set the 'track at rest' bit, avoiding hanging notes (noticeable at start of DEZ's theme)
	- Optimised .silencefm6 using some S2 logic
	- Sound_PlaySFX no longer checks v_fadeout_counter
	- FadeOutMusic no longer calls FadeOutSFX
	- SpeedUpMusic and SlowDownMusic no longer set v_main_tempo_timeout
	- PSGSetVolume now corrects values that are >=$10
	- PSGSetFreq and .restpsg don't continue to FinishTrackUpdate

	- cfPanningAMSFMS has an additional check
	- Added a (commented out) call to FadeOutSFX in Sound_PlayBGM
- .nospeedshoes no longer sets v_main_tempo_timeout to the header tempo. This is to avoid unintended tempo overflow on the first frame of playback, delaying the song by a frame. This also helps to prevent hanging notes (noticeable at start of DEZ's theme)
- Removed useless 'even' from under FMDACInitBytes
- Removed last '0's from FMDACInitBytes and PSGInitBytes (were actually 'even's)

09/07/2015
= v2.3 =

- Optimised PSG envelopes with more efficient use of flags
- Made previous version's bugs toggleable with Fix_DriverBugs
- Added Valley Bell's Sega chant pan fix
- Added Valley Bell's 0 FM track fix

- Un-commented-out the calls under Sound_PlayBGM
- S2-ified FadeOutSFX
- Corrected StopSoundAndMusic comment
- Improved cfFadeInToPrevious FM6 fix
- Reduced RAM usage by employing a trick from S&K's driver: the SFX/special SFX share RAM with the 1up music backup
- Switched to using 'STRUCT' to define track RAM
- Defined driver RAM with phase/ds.b combo
- Split v_1up_ram_copy into v_1up_ram_copy and v_1up_variables (variables now go after tracks)
- As part of the SFX/track backup share, the playback control bytes of all tracks are separately backed-up
- Made Sound_PlayBGM's extra life code clear the special SFX tracks' 'is playing' bit
- Special SFX code above FMDACInitBytes now uses tst.b instead of tst.w
- Moved v_special_voice_ptr back next to v_voice_ptr (RAM is dynamic now, so it can go here without wasting any RAM if unused)

- Reduced zTrack size to $2E by changing LoopCounters from 4 bytes to 2 bytes, as S&K's driver has it
- Reduced zTrack size to $2C with some track-specific RAM usage
- FinishTrackUpdate no longer clears VolFlutter on non-PSG tracks
- Removed now-useless label (loc_721B6)

01/12/2015

- Removed some excessive optimisation
- Removed needless 'Clownacy |' comments
- Removed pointless commented-out code
- Rearranged constants and flags, allowing DAC ID constants to be used in your hack's code
- Switched back to S1's Sega chant sample (S2's is just S1's with a bit cut off at the end)
- Fixed mistake in Mega PCM's code I made at some point (an iy+3 was changed to iy+2, breaking panning)
- Made everything case-sensitive-friendly

05/12/2015
= v2.4.1 =
- Added (proper, unlike S2!) fix for music interrupting SFX, causing distortion
- Made .silencefm6 more like it was in S2's driver
- Removed some instances where DAC is enabled with WriteFMI. Mega PCM can do that on its own
- Allowed FM6 to enable itself, letting a song use both FM6 and DAC tracks (the channel itself alternates, so they can't run at the same time)
- Removed some instances where DAC is disabled with WriteFMI. The above change means FM6 can do that on its own
- Made PlaySega (68k mode) manually enable DAC

12/12/2015
= v2.4.2 =
- Removed redundant instructions under .silencefm6
- Removed WriteFMIorIIMain, and merged its function into the one thing that used it, like S2's driver
- Fixed PSG noise channel not shutting up when a new song starts
- Rewrote PauseMusic to be more like it was in S2's driver
- Fixed Mega PCM DAC samples not pausing properly (holy shit this has been here since v2.0)

= v2.5 =
- Fixed hanging notes on music that doesn't define all tracks
- Optimised some track RAM write looping
- Added missing S3/S3D PSG envelopes
- Overhauled SMPS2ASM PSG defining
- Slightly lowered pitch on all DAC samples
- Updated SMPS2ASM
- Renamed DAC_Entry arguments to not conflict with comments
- Removed support for other drivers from _smps2asm_inc.asm (a pain to maintain)
- Updated sound driver disassembly (track RAM is better-defined)

- Made disabled coordination flags safer
- Removed old unused SMPS 68k Type 1a track pointers
- Made SFX_SFXChannelRAM and SFX_BGMChannelRAM word-sized
- Ported SMPS Z80's TL handling, fixing S3K DEZ1 (bit 7 lets it be changed by volume)
- Added support for negative transpositions, fixing S3D intro (S3D uses these)
- Shrinked FM_Notes, to allow for negative transpositions
- Removed ReverseFreqs. It was fun while it lasted, but I'm not about to waste time figuring out how to make a negative shrunken FM_Notes
- Corrected smpsVcTotalLevel errors in OOZ, Ending, and Title Screen
- Corrected smpsVcTotalLevel errors in SFX 55 and 5C (D5 and DC)
- Corrected FM5 channel transposition in SFX BC (Spin Dash release)
- Added 'readme.txt' files to 'music' and 'SFX' folders, detailing bugfixes made and where to find SMPS2ASM
- Added URLs to Mega PCM's thread at start of Mega PCM files

- Enhanced SMPS2ASM to ignore S3-specific smpsFade
- Reverted bugged optimisations to PSG volume envelopes (fixes VVZ2)
- Added support for negative track pointers, fixing SFX CC (holy cow, another one I haven't noticed since v2.0)

02/07/2016
= v2.6 =
- New DPCM tables were ported from SMPS-Treasure, speeding up DPCM loop (unlike SMPS-Treasure, these tables are generated by the DAC driver during initialisation, so they don't waste ROM like the volume table)
- Made Spin Dash toggleable, so its code isn't assembled if you're not using it
- Fixed bug during song initialisation that caused the last two sound queues to be accidentally cleared
- Ported S2's version of Sound_Play (zCycleQueue)
- Music/SFX/SpecSFX data has been merged into 'metadata tables', simplifying their addition or modification (for example, the music metadata table contains the music's pointer, speed-shoes tempo, and playback flags)
- Restored compatibility with official (flamewing's) SMPS2ASM
- All tracks use zTrack.VoicePtr now (saves some RAM)
- Overall RAM cleanup
- Some Z80 access was made 'safe' (interrupt can't interrupt Z80 bus request, and accidentally deassert it)
- Fixed OOZ oil slide SFX (was updating FM volume on a PSG channel)
- Added check to prevent above bug from having any negative effects, just like S2's driver
- A branch is available that uses the stock v1.1 MegaPCM

12/08/2016
= v2.7 =
- Support for the 32X
- Support for four PWM tracks
- Fixed bug where Special SFX incorrectly mute PSG3 while it's being used by SFX (thanks, Markey)
- Added proper volume cap check to DoFadeIn (thanks again, Markey)
- Fixed bug where PSG 1&2 are not muted during SFX initialisation (Markey, stop, please)
- Added a bugfix from S2's driver that stops cfStopTrack from altering the stack too much on DAC channels
- Tried to reduce name collision with MegaPCM by adding a prefix to most labels
- UpdateDAC has been restructured, so its stack usage is identical to FM and PSG (kind of undoing that last bugfix :( )
- Made MegaPCM check that YM2612 isn't busy before enabling DAC (fixes muted drums at start of some songs)
- SFX now properly update on the frame that a new song is played

20/03/2020
= v2.7+ =
- Changed FM voice format, like what S2's driver did, for optimised reading
- Split DAC table from Mega PCM Z80 .asm file
- Rearranged file/folder structure, so files meant for the user to edit (like DAC samples and PSG envelopes) are in the root folder, the off-limits engine is in the 'engine' folder, and the optional/only-useful-during-installation files are kept in an 'extra' folder
- Added SMPS2ASM equates for Chaotix' PWM samples (these equates were also applied to the included Chaotix dump)
- Fixed typo in smpsHeaderVoiceUVB, causing errors
- Restored music/SFX/Special SFX FM voice pointer to relative 16-bit value
- Changed some labels and symbols to suit ValleyBell's suggestions (https://vgmrips.net/misc/SMPS_Disasm_Terms.txt)
- Added PWMSilenceAll, so PWM is silenced with the rest of the driver
- Changed internal branch tables to offset tables (requires modifications to user file 'Sound IDs.asm')
- Removed 68k-based Sega chant playback support (fewer dependencies)
- Removed v_playsnd0 and f_voice_selector, after making them redundant
- Renamed UpdateMusic, so old S1 code that accidentally still called the driver should correctly flag an error now
- In-driver track RAM addresses are now relative (this is in preparation of possible binary-blob)
- Changed PauseMusic to not "resume" DAC channel (this should be pointless, since that track doesn't use voices, and Mega PCM handles panning)
- Removed a redundant bugfix (sorry, Markey)
- Removed PlaybackControlBackup from track RAM/SMPS_Track (relevant data is stored in unused bit of PlaybackControl)
- Fixed bug introduced in v2.7, where the extra life jingle would cause the level's music to have a delayed DAC track
- Made PWM be silenced on song start (consider PWM SFX extremely experimental; use with caution)
- Added support for disabling noise mode on PSG 3 (this is done in the same way as SMPS Z80)
- Adjusted PSG fading, so it's more in-line with FM and DAC (fades in roughly $20 frames, rather than $10)
- Changed cfChangeFMVolume to not run at all on PSG channels (the SMPS Z80 way)
- Added bugfix for PSG fading (volume updates would conflict with volume envelopes)
- Fixed held volume envelops only updating the volume every other frame (silly SMPS 68k Type 2)
- Added support for negative FM voice pointers in Special SFX
- Changed DAC_Entry pitch value so it's the playback speed in Hz instead of a djnz loop counter

02/07/2021
= v2.8 =
- Added FM volume attenuation clamping, to prevent overflow (this bug would cause Sonic 2's final boss music to have an extremely loud instrument while fading-in after a 1-UP jingle finishes playing)
- Inconsistent DAC/FM6 panning behaviour has been corrected
- Ported SMPS Z80-style frequency modulation, fixing several issues in SMPS Z80 songs (such as broken pitch bends at the start of Sonic & Knuckles' credits music)
- Bugs in the 'smpsSetVol' coordination flag have been corrected (fixes missing PSG notes in the Sonic & Knuckles credits music)
- Ported FM frequency modulation from SMPS 68k Type 2, so that Carnival Night Zone's and Launch Base Zone's music are finally compatible with this driver
- Fix note timeout being performed on first frame of playback
- The sound queue processing logic has been completely remade, hopefully fixing a number of subtle bugs (the old code was *very* bad)
- Assorted optimisations
- TempoWait can no longer delay tracks on their first frame of playback (this is a proper fix to the hanging-note bug that Sonic 2's driver used a work-around for, which can sometimes be heard at the start of Sonic 2's Death Egg Zone music)
- Mega PCM has been replaced with a custom two-channel DAC driver: the first channel is used by music, while the second channel can be used by DAC SFX
- Fix SFX and Special SFX tracks not being updated on the same frame that a music track uses the 'fade to prevous song' coordination flag
- Fading-in has been overhauled, so that SFX are no longer muted while fading is performed: rather, SFX are now faded along with everything else
- Bugs relating to PSG volume values have been corrected
- The dependency on the 'Graphics_Flags'/'v_megadrive' variable has been removed, easing the process of integrating this driver into homebrew

02/07/2021
= v2.8.0.1 =
- Fixed the 'Settings.asm' files for Sonic 1 and Sonic 2

XX/XX/XXXX
= v2.8.1 =
- Moved Size_of_DAC_driver_guess out of 'Settings.asm'
- Added a set of SMPS2ASM songs and SFX in the 'extras/SMPS2ASM files' directory, including...
-- Sonic 1
-- Sonic 2
-- Sonic 3
-- Sonic 3 (prototype) (music only)
-- Sonic 3D Blast
-- Knuckles' Chaotix (music only)
-- Sonic CD (SFX only)
- Fixed a race condition in 'SMPS_Setup' that could cause a freeze
